									<p class="bottom-space">LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. (“LGEIL”) is committed to protecting your privacy on the Internet. We believe that it is important for you to know what we do with your personal information. When it comes to consumer data collected electronically, LG Electronics will provide notice, choice, access and security in ways described below. In general, you, as our customer, can visit LG Electronics on the World Wide Web without having to reveal any personal information that you do not want to disclose. BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW.

									<div class="content-block">
										<h2><span>A. Information Collected</span></h2>
										<div class="text-block">
											<p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected on this website and does not apply to information collected by LGEIL through any other means. <br>We collect two types of information from visitors to this website: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non- Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.</p>
											<div>
												<h3>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
												<p>"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. LG Electronics collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of manners in which we may collect your personally identifiable information on this website: </p>
												<p>We may collect your first and last name and product or service details if you contact us with a question related to our products or services;</p>
												<p>We may collect your first and last name and mailing address if you request a product on this website; We may collect your name, email address or phone number if you contact us with a question.</p>
												<p>We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and/or </p>
												<p>The above list provides an example of the personally identifiable information that may be collected on this website. If you do not want LG Electronics to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us. </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h3>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
												<p>"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, location, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via this website:</p>
												<p>Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view. </p>
												<p>Cookie -- We may use a variety of methods, including "cookies" to collect information.</p>
												<p>What is a cookie?</p>
												<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. You can find more information about cookies at:http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
												<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to ensure that advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
												<p>The cookies used on our Sites and/or Services have been categorized based on the categories found in the ICC UK Cookie guide. A list of all the cookies used on our Sites and/or Services by category is set out below.</p>
												<p><b>Web Beacons. </b>(also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") "Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. </p>
												<h4>Performance Cookies</h4>
												<p>LG Electronics collects cookies on our Sites and/or Services to capture information about page visits (e.g. “performance cookies.”) This information is anonymous and LG Electronics uses this information only internally - to deliver the most effective content to our visitors. Information from the cookie is used to gauge page popularity, analyze traffic patterns on our Sites and/or Services and guide development of other improvements to our Sites and/or Services.</p>
												<h4>Targeting, Performance, and Functionality Cookies</h4>
												<p>In our email programs, LG Electronics employs some tracking methods (e.g. “targeting, performance, and functionality cookies”). We track “opens” via a tracking pixel in the email- meaning we track who opens our e-mail messages and when you open our e-mail messages; and we track “clicks” via encoded URLs-meaning we track whether you click on the links contained in our e-mail messages. This information is used internally only to help us deliver relevant messaging, and is not shared with any third parties.</p>
												<h4>Functionality and Necessary Cookies</h4>
												<p>LG Electronics does not require that you accept cookies and/or you may withdraw your consent to our use of cookies at any time by adjusting your browser's privacy settings, however, some functionality on our Sites (e.g. “functionality cookies”), our product or service check-out process, and Services may be disabled if you decline to accept cookies ( e.g. “necessary cookies”).</p>
												<h4>User Opt-In and Opt-Out</h4>
												<p>LG Electronics licenses technology to serve advertisements on other Sites and within its content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, LG Electronics may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements and third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Data with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to data about you, including usage data. Third parties that provide marketing programs on LG Electronics’ behalf are responsible for maintaining both cookie opt-in and opt-out functionality. We and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Sites and other web sites subject to your prior opt-in if and when required by the applicable laws.</p>
												<p>If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising any longer, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your Personal Data. To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. <br>Please note that even if you choose to remove your Personal Data (opt out), you might still see advertisements while you're browsing online. </p>
												<h4>Email Opt-Out</h4>
												<p>From time to time, we communicate with users who subscribe to our services via email or text message. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional. However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on this website or if you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with third parties. The opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate box if such checkbox is available at the points where personally identifiable information is collected or by contacting us. We will process your unsubscribe as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. You also may opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of the email. <br>How will LGEIL use the information it obtain? <br>We use your information that is collected through the Sites primarily for the following purposes:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>• To deliver or provide the service; </li>
													<li>• To provide customer service;</li>

In addition, LGEIL may share your data with its affiliates and subsidiaries around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the data for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible.
